The more you inflate, the more points you earn. However, if you inflate it too much, the balloon will pop and you will lose all the points you earn on that balloon. \n\nTo avoid losing your points, you can cash out BEFORE the balloon pops. \n\nThere is a limited number of balloons, so try to earn as many points as possible on each balloon!";
